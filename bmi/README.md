# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`






Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Sure, here's an explanation of the code for your GitHub README:

### BMI Calculator App

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using React. It allows users to input their weight in pounds and height in inches and calculates their BMI. Based on the calculated BMI, it provides a message indicating whether the person is underweight, a healthy weight, or overweight.

### Features:

- User-friendly interface with clear instructions.
- Calculates BMI based on weight and height inputs.
- Provides feedback on BMI status (underweight, healthy weight, or overweight).
- Option to reload the calculator.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.
4. Open your web browser and access the app at `http://localhost:3000` (by default).

### Code Explanation:

- The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- State variables are used to manage the weight, height, calculated BMI, and message to be displayed.
- The `calculateBmi` function is called when the user submits the form. It calculates the BMI and updates the state variables accordingly.
- The `reload` function allows the user to reset the calculator.
- CSS styles are applied to create an attractive and responsive user interface.

Feel free to modify and customize the code as needed for your specific requirements or use it as a starting point for your own projects.
